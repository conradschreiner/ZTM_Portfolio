# password_checker

This folder contains a python file and  virtual environment. The purpose of the check_my_pass program is to check if a password has been exposed during a data leak. It checks it through a GET request to pwndedpasswords.com's API. It protects the passwords input by hashing them (a form of encryption). One can run the program through the terminal on a Mac or Linuc machine, or via the command line on a windows machine.

Technologies Used:
